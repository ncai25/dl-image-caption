# Image Captioning with Flickr 8k Dataset

Generate English captions for images. Two models are implemented: RNN and Transformer. 
Both models use preprocessed image features (2048-D vectors from ResNet-50).

## Results
RNN (acc >30% perp ≤ 20)
acc: 0.344	 perp: 16.065

Transformer (acc ~ 35%, perp ≤ 18)
acc: 0.345	 perp: 16.21979
